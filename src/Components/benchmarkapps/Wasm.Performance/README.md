## Blazor WASM benchmarks

These projects assist in Benchmarking Components.
See https://github.com/aspnet/Benchmarks#benchmarks for usage guidance on using the Benchmarking tool with your application

### Running the benchmarks

The TestApp is a regular BlazorWASM project and can be run using `dotnet run`. The Driver is an app that speaks the Benchmark protocol. You generally do not need to run the Driver locally, but if you were to do so, you require docker. Here are the commands you would need to run it locally:

1. `dotnet publish -c Release -r linux-x64 Driver/Wasm.Performance.Driver.csproj`
2. `docker build -t blazor-local -f ./local.dockerfile . `
3. `docker run -it blazor-local`

To run the benchmark app in the Benchmark server, run

```
dotnet run -- --config \aspnetcore\src\Components\benchmarkapps\Wasm.Performance\benchmarks.compose.json --services.blazorwasmbenchmark.endpoints <BenchmarkServerUri>
```
